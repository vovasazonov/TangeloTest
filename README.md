# TangeloTest

I implemented an MVP style popup system. May be it is not good idea to split popup into view and model, but there was no time to think more about it.

I wanted to do everything classic. Without DI containers. Ability to read the code from point A (Entry.cs) to point B.

If there was more time, I would implement modal popups (yes, no), with ability to subscribe to action. Experimented with other architecture (without using MVP). Add more beauty to test screen (effects, particle system and other)

##
With API of popup there is ability to open popup immediatele (dont wait to load popup) and with waiting load.
